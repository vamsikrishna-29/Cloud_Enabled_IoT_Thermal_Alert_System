## **🏗️ System Architecture**
![system architecture](https://github.com/vamsikrishna-29/Cloud_Enabled_IoT_Thermal_Alert_System/blob/0623ae5022d89e75c99516583fbe8b98aa73e5f0/system%20architecture.png)

The system is centered around the **LPC2148 ARM7 Microcontroller**, which acquires temperature data from the **LM35 sensor** through its built-in ADC. The processed temperature is displayed on the **16×2 LCD (8-bit mode)** and compared with the configured set-point. The **ESP-01 Wi-Fi module** enables communication with the **ThingSpeak cloud** for real-time temperature logging and remote set-point updates. Users can also configure the set-point locally using the **4×4 matrix keypad**, while the **DS1307 RTC** provides accurate date and time information. The configured set-point is stored in the **I²C EEPROM** to retain data after power loss. Whenever the measured temperature exceeds the configured threshold, the **buzzer** and **LED** are activated to provide audible and visual alerts.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

| **Module** | **Working Principle** |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| 🌡️ **LM35 Temperature Sensor** | The LM35 continuously senses the ambient temperature and produces an analog voltage that is directly proportional to the measured temperature. This analog output is forwarded to the ADC channel of the LPC2148 microcontroller for further processing. |
| 🔢 **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** | The built-in ADC of the LPC2148 converts the analog voltage received from the LM35 into a digital value. The microcontroller processes this value to calculate the corresponding temperature, which is then used for display, cloud logging, and threshold comparison. |
| 🧠 **LPC2148 ARM7 Microcontroller** | Acting as the core controller, the LPC2148 coordinates all peripherals and executes the application logic. It acquires temperature data, manages local and remote set-point updates, controls communication with external devices, compares the measured temperature with the configured threshold, and activates alerts whenever necessary. |
| 📺 **16×2 LCD (8-Bit Mode)** | The LCD provides real-time visual feedback by displaying the current temperature, configured set-point, date, time, and system status. It also displays notifications such as cloud synchronization, set-point updates, and invalid input messages, enabling easy user interaction. |
| ☁️ **ESP-01 Wi-Fi Module** | The ESP-01 establishes a Wi-Fi connection and enables communication between the LPC2148 and the ThingSpeak cloud platform through UART. It periodically uploads temperature readings and retrieves the latest remote set-point, allowing users to monitor and control the system over the Internet. |
| 📊 **ThingSpeak Cloud Platform** | ThingSpeak stores temperature readings received from the ESP-01 and provides graphical visualization for remote monitoring. It also allows users to update the temperature set-point remotely, which is periodically read by the embedded system for automatic synchronization. |
| ⌨️ **4×4 Matrix Keypad** | The keypad enables users to configure the temperature set-point locally. The entered value is validated to ensure it falls within the permissible range before being accepted and stored, preventing invalid system configurations. |
| 💾 **I²C EEPROM** | The EEPROM stores the latest valid set-point using the I²C communication protocol. During system startup, the stored value is retrieved and loaded automatically, ensuring that the configured threshold is preserved even after power interruptions. |
| 🕒 **DS1307 RTC Module** | The RTC maintains accurate date and time information independently of the microcontroller. The LPC2148 reads this information periodically and displays it on the LCD, while also using it for time-based tasks such as scheduled cloud communication. |
| 🚨 **Buzzer & LED Alert System** | The LPC2148 continuously compares the measured temperature with the configured set-point. Whenever the temperature exceeds the threshold, both the buzzer and LED are activated simultaneously to provide immediate audible and visual alerts. The alert remains active until the temperature falls below the configured limit. |
| 🔄 **Overall System Operation** | The system continuously performs temperature sensing, ADC conversion, real-time display, cloud synchronization, set-point management, EEPROM storage, and alert generation in a cyclic manner. This integrated operation ensures reliable real-time thermal monitoring, cloud-based data logging, and remote system management. |

## 📊 Output

The implemented system continuously monitors the ambient temperature using the LM35 sensor and displays the real-time temperature along with the current time on the LCD. The measured temperature is periodically uploaded to the ThingSpeak cloud platform through the ESP-01 Wi-Fi module for remote monitoring and data logging.

Users can remotely update the temperature set-point through the ThingSpeak channel. The LPC2148 controller retrieves the updated set-point, stores it in EEPROM, and immediately uses it for thermal alert generation. When the measured temperature exceeds the configured set-point, the system activates the buzzer to notify the user.

### Output Highlights
- Real-time temperature displayed on the LCD.
- Temperature data uploaded to the ThingSpeak cloud.
- Live graphical visualization of temperature on ThingSpeak.
- Remote set-point update through the cloud.
- Automatic EEPROM storage of the updated set-point.
- Buzzer activation when the temperature exceeds the set-point.
